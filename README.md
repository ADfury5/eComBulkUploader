# eComBulkUploader

**eComBulkUploader** is a Python-based tool crafted to automate the bulk upload of product data to eCommerce platforms, reducing both time and effort required in managing large inventories. This tool is particularly useful for businesses that need to handle the upload or update of multiple product listings efficiently and accurately.

## Features
- **Bulk Product Upload**: Manages large batches of products efficiently by reading from a CSV file and making API requests to the eCommerce platform.
- **Image Upload**: Automates the uploading of product images, retrieves their corresponding URLs, and includes these in the product listings.
- **API Integration**: Adapts to any eCommerce platform with a RESTful API, handling authentication using API keys.
- **Error Handling**: Provides error reports for any upload failures, ensuring users are informed of any issues during the upload process.
- **Rate Limiting**: Includes configurable delays between API requests to prevent hitting API rate limits, ensuring smooth operation.

## How It Works
1. **Data Reading**: The tool reads product details such as name, description, price, SKU, category, stock quantity, and image paths from a CSV file.
2. **Image Handling**: Images linked to products are uploaded to the platform, and URLs are retrieved for inclusion in the product data.
3. **Product Creation**: For each product, the tool sends a POST request to the platform's API, which includes the necessary product data.
4. **Request Management**: Implements a pause between requests to accommodate API rate limits and avoid overloading the platform.

**eComBulkUploader** aims to save significant amounts of time, reduce human error, and ensure seamless bulk uploads for extensive product catalogs. It serves as an invaluable asset for eCommerce businesses looking to optimize their product management processes.
